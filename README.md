# Word Party
Word Party is an online multiplayer game about guessing words containing a certain substring of 2 or 3 letters. The timer gradually decreases as more players enter correct words, until someone fails to do so and loses a heart. The last player standing is the winner!
This game was inspired by JKLM's Bomb Party.
